# TaleTunes

Hi,

TaleTunes will be an audiomixer and soundfx tool for tabletop roleplaying games. The idear is to make it a browserapp for desktop and maybe mobile devices. Using the YT API [YT Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference) to build an intuativ interface helping gms to make smooth audio transitions between narrative events like battle, visions or themes and therefore create a more immersiv experience. The goal is to have an interface that enables the user to easily save, organize and manage groups of music- and ambience-video urls and control those groups, called "Tunes". Each "Tune" can be played, muted, faded in and out or set a volume to fade towards. I'd like the app to run locally, requiering no profiles or logins, by downloading a txt or json file, containing the build "groups" and their urls. Side goal of this is it to gain experience with GitHub, GIT, JS and softwaredevelopment in general, to feel free to give me advice.
